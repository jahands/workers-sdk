title: MCP servers
description: Add local and remote MCP tools.
---

You can add external tools to opencode using the _Model Context Protocol_, or MCP. opencode supports both:

- Local servers
- And remote servers

Once added, MCP tools are automatically available to the LLM alongside built-in tools.

---

## Built-in servers

opencode includes built-in MCP servers that are automatically available without any configuration:

### Cloudflare Documentation

The **Cloudflare Docs** MCP server provides access to search Cloudflare's documentation directly from your conversations. This server is automatically initialized and includes tools for:

- Searching Cloudflare Workers documentation
- Finding information about R2, D1, KV, and other Cloudflare services
- Getting help with Cloudflare APIs and configurations

The AI can automatically search Cloudflare docs when discussing Workers, Pages, or other Cloudflare services without requiring explicit commands.

---

## Configure

You can define MCP servers in your opencode config under `mcp`.

### Local

Add a local MCP servers under `mcp.localmcp`.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
	"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
	"mcp": {
		"localmcp": {
			"type": "local",
			"command": ["bun", "x", "my-mcp-command"],
			"enabled": true,
			"environment": {
				"MY_ENV_VAR": "my_env_var_value"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

You can also disable a server by setting `enabled` to `false`. This is useful if you want to temporarily disable a server without removing it from your config.

### Remote

Add a remote MCP servers under `mcp.remotemcp`.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
	"$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
	"mcp": {
		"remotemcp": {
			"type": "remote",
			"url": "https://my-mcp-server.com",
			"enabled": true
		}
	}
}
```
