# Wrangler OpenCode Integration PRD

## Overview

This PRD outlines the integration of OpenCode, an AI coding agent, into Wrangler CLI to provide developers with an intelligent assistant specifically tailored for Cloudflare Workers development.

## Background

**OpenCode** is an open-source AI coding agent built for the terminal that features:

- A responsive, native, themeable terminal UI
- Automatic LSP integration for better code understanding
- Support for multiple AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, local models)
- Multi-agent parallel work capabilities
- Shareable session links
- Client/server architecture

**Wrangler** is the command-line tool for building Cloudflare Workers, providing commands for development, deployment, and management of Workers applications.

## Problem Statement

Developers working with Cloudflare Workers often need assistance with:

- Understanding Workers-specific APIs and patterns
- Debugging Workers code and configuration
- Learning best practices for Workers development
- Implementing common Workers use cases (queues, KV, D1, etc.)
- Troubleshooting deployment and runtime issues

Currently, developers must context-switch between their development environment and external AI tools, losing the context of their current project and Workers-specific knowledge.

## Solution

Integrate OpenCode directly into Wrangler CLI to provide an AI assistant that:

1. Has deep knowledge of Cloudflare Workers APIs and patterns
2. Understands the current project context (wrangler.jsonc, code structure)
3. Can execute Workers-specific commands and operations
4. Provides contextual help and code generation

## Goals

### Primary Goals

- Provide seamless AI assistance within the Wrangler CLI workflow
- Reduce context switching for developers seeking AI help
- Improve developer productivity with Workers-specific AI guidance
- Maintain the existing Wrangler CLI experience and performance

### Secondary Goals

- Enable advanced AI-powered Workers development workflows
- Provide a foundation for future AI integrations in Workers tooling
- Demonstrate Cloudflare's commitment to developer experience innovation

## Non-Goals

- Replace existing Wrangler commands or functionality
- Require internet connectivity for basic Wrangler operations
- Significantly increase Wrangler bundle size or startup time
- Support non-Workers related AI assistance
